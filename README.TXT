You Only Get One, MATCH!
Â© 2014 Wingless Little People

Made with Python and Pygame

Instructions:
-------------
Macario is a pyrotechnician who is responsible for fireworks in different locations. He is so hopeless that he keeps losing his matchboxes, but at least he always manages to keep a single match! Help him get his job done while travelling with him around the globe. Light all the fireworks in each level before the match extinguishes. Use arrows to walk, jump, and crouch. Press down to light the fireworks in each level before the flame goes off. Mind the critters! If you fall or run too fast, the match will burn out faster.

SPACE and Z jumps too.

To play run the application file "game".

Press P or ESC for pause.

F12 will take a screenshot.
